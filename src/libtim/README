subroutine timeph added on 1/97 by JM,
timeph is actually the same as subroutine time, but
the name time is an intrinsic function in HP fortran
so the name had to be changed.  Both subroutines are
currently left in the library, but as coded are recompilled
on the HP's it will be neccessary to switch their call statements
to call timeph to access the subroutine.
